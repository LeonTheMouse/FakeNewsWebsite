            <p>Fake news plays a significant role in the dissemination of false knowledge in society. Wide outlets like Facebook and Twitter have been saturated with headlines and news stories that are consumed by millions of users every day as social and digital media has become a key news source in recent years. While there are still credible and trustworthy news outlets, many influencers have been persuaded to be more lenient with the material transmitted on their pages by powerful incentives, most of which are economic or political in nature. Some of it is disinformation aimed at undermining national security, some of it is actually non-political misinformation that has gone viral, and most of it is false knowledge disguised as irony or humor for entertainment purposes (RSIS 2018). This form of fake news is especially nefarious because irony allows people to disclaim commitment to an idea while still espousing it.

        <section>-Currently, several algorithms already exist to detect fake news. These algorithms use different components of speech, such as, connotation, various lexicon markers, or blatantly cross-checking factual statements in the text, to classify news pieces based on their level of validity. Because there are so many different variables to consider when implementing these solutions, very few have been implemented due to a lack of agreement and consensus as to which is effective enough to be put into use. Additionally, the algorithms responsible for creating echo chambers have put higher responsibility on the user to recognize fake news than the company itself for stopping the spread. These algorithms create a “biased user” that sees only their interests and blindly accepts them, and there is a lack of “critical users” online that take the initiative to responsibly accept or deny information online (Zimmer et. al 2019).

        <section>-Our group determined that the most effective way of combating fake news is through a bill.  By providing users with transparency on how their data is being used, on how the algorithm of news works and what they are being presented with they can determine which sources they trust most.</section>
